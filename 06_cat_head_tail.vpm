# Taking a peek at files

Different commands to view files in the command line:

- `cat`: spit out the whole file. 
- `head`: print the start of the file.
- `tail`: print the end of the file. 
- `less`: when a file is too long for `cat`. 

## Tip: monitor files with `tail -f`. 

- Example:

```
python examples/python/filewriter.py
tail -f examples/python/fw_output.txt
```
