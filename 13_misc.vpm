- A nice way to shorten common commands. 
- Store them in `~/.bash_aliases` in your home directory.

    - alias gpo="git push origin"
    - typing gpo expands to the command.

- See: `~/.bash_aliases`

- dot files
    - there are configurations for everything
- vim: map Caps Lock to Escape
- learn your package manager
