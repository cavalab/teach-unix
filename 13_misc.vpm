# Miscellaneous tips 

- `history`: shows you command history
    - `history | grep x`: find that command you used
- `Alt + .`: pulls up the last set of arguments to a command.

## Aliases
- A nice way to shorten common commands. 
- Store them in `~/.bash_aliases` in your home directory. 

- Examples 
    - alias gpo="git push origin"
    - typing gpo expands to the command.

- See: `~/.bash_aliases`
