# Unix Basics 

- Unix Philosophy:
    - minimal, modular software development
    - each program does *one thing* well
    - composability
        - write programs to work together
        - programs all input and output text streams

- **everything** is a file!
    - specifically, a flat text file

- the *shell*: the interpreter and language for your inputs 
    - sh, *bash*, ksh, csh
        - mostly interoperable
    - also a scripting language!
        - e.g.: ~/.scripts/proxy_toggle.sh
